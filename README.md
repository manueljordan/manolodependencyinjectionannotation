# Description

Basic **Spring Framework** application, it covers and works with one of the styles of configuration available about the mechanism of **Dependency Injection** used by Spring. The sample code uses two kind of layers, they are a **Repository** and a **Service**, it how a best practice.
						
Furthermore, about **Java Programming**, the composition applied between the 
components such as a **Repository** to a **Service**, is done through interfaces 
and not through concrete classes. It how a best practice, for the purpose to swap 
out components easily.

This application is **standalone**, there is no **Web Environment**.
